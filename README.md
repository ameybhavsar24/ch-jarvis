### Convex Hull Simulation with Gift Wrapping / Jarvis' March.
The code for the algorithm was inspired from [Jarvis' Algorithm | Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-1-jarviss-algorithm-or-wrapping/)

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is used for simulation.

#### Usage
1. Go to [Convex Hull Simulation](https://ameybhavsar24.github.io/ch-jarvis/)
2. Click on the grey coloured canvas to add points.
3. When the number the points >= 3, the algorithm will calculate the convex hull for the set of points.
